			This month, we welcome Paulmichael Blasucci from Quicken Loans.
			<p>
				Modern high-level languages offer lots of great features.
				However, when it comes time to do systems-level programming, one is fast with some hard choices.
				Give up the higher-level features we all love (by using C), or get stuck in the morass that is C++.
			</p>
			<p>But, wait!</p>
			<p>
				Rust offers a third choice.
				It promises high-level expressivity with the power and control needed for systems programming.
				This talk provides a general introduction to Rust.
				It'll introduce the basic syntax, developer tools, and overall "feel" of the language.
				We'll also spend some time focusing on where and when it makes the most sense to use Rust.
			</p>
			<p><h3>About Paulmichael</h3></p>
