			20 years ago, Java started supporting regular expressions and XML, and JavaScript learned to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) in Internet Explorer 6 and Netscape.
			Neanderthals just stopped hunting mammoths after the dot-com bubble burst, while Millennials were mastering the usage of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" target="_blank"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>  to send SOAP messages, which allowed users to buy philosophical compositions, including "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss" target="_blank">In Da Club</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y654TxcRuL0" target="_blank">Chihuahua</a>."

			We designate types in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> and run it on the server, and at the same time, there is a JVM implementation in WebAssembly.
			We write <code>var</code> and anonymous functions in Java and define private fields in JavaScript classes.

			JDK 21, the latest LTS release, has been out for almost a year.
			It's as if a Tarot card set has appeared from the fortune-teller’s sleeve.
			Each card has its own interpretation.
			These are mystical virtual streams, records that disappear when deconstructed, and collections that are now traversed backwards.
			It's also time to give back to the world a new "Hello World" application.
			The life cycle of tasks executing in different threads can be defined through structural concurrency.
			Some of the innovations tend to appear as features in the future, and some seek to show new wisdom, such as preparations for the ban on dynamic loading of agents.
