			An effective web service requires awareness of many new, as well as some exisiting technologies.
			This month's meeting will be presented by Arthur Sambar (see bio below), Senior Technical Manager with <a href="http://www.silverstream.com/" target="_top">SilverStream Software</a>, and will cover the core technologies in detail, including SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI - and how to leverage industry standards such as J2EE&trade; and XML.
			In addition, you will learn the fundamental skills needed to produce, deploy, and consume a web service.
			Topics include how to build a web service, expose it via SOAP, describe it via WSDL, register it via UDDI, and finally discover a web service and invoke it using a SOAP client.
			Deploy all of your web services into a standard J2EE&trade; application server such as SilverStream Application Server, WebSphere, or Web Logic.
